 Fixes:
Make water impassable (It's set to impassable but it's not working)
Black box around Stewart? He's a png so it should be transparent
The collisions break a bit when the map scrolls, it's because I blit the sprites to x-xshift,y-yshift but it reads x,y for collisions, might be easy and might be incredibly difficult

 Additions:
More sprites
Make a map
Minimap in the corner
Add NPCs
Add Items/pickups
Add health
Add Monsters
Add party members
Buildings
Dialog boxes
More stuff, Basically I want to be like an Ultima/Final Fantasy game
